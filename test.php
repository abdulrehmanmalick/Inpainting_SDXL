The garden features five English Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) shrubs in 1-gallon pots, each 24-36 inches tall, strategically placed under a charming wooden deck to provide fragrance and attract butterflies. Near the left-side fence, two Black Knight Butterfly Bushes (Buddleja davidii) in 2-gallon pots, each 6-8 feet tall, serve as focal points drawing butterflies and adding vertical interest. Along the perimeter, eight American Boxwood (Buxus sempervirens) hedges in 2-gallon pots, ranging from 5-10 feet tall, create a lush, green barrier for privacy. Near the deck steps, three Tuscan Blue Rosemary plants (Salvia rosmarinus) in 1-gallon pots, each 3-5 feet tall, offer aromatic foliage and insect resistance. Throughout the yard, four clusters of Caradonna Salvia (Salvia nemorosa) in 1-gallon pots, each 18-24 inches tall, add vibrant purple and blue hues, enhancing the garden\'s color palette and attracting butterflies. The garden combines a mix of textures and colors with drought-tolerant plants, ensuring a water-wise and insect-resistant environment. Visible elements include a wooden deck, a sturdy fence, and well-defined walkways, all contributing to a picturesque and serene outdoor space. The overall color scheme emphasizes purples, blues, and greens, harmoniously blending with the traditional French Country aesthetic.","negative_prompt":"Blurry, pixelated, cartoon-like, synthetic textures, oversaturated colors, unnatural lighting, exaggerated shadows","prompt_2":" Design a French Country-inspired backyard garden suitable for USDA zone 10a, emphasizing traditional aesthetics, water-wise planting, and insect resistance.
